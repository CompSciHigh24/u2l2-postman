# Code Along: Exploring APIs with Postman and PokeAPI

In this code along, we will be learning how to make our first API request using **Postman** and the **PokeAPI**. We will cover installing Postman, navigating the PokeAPI documentation, and creating and testing a request to retrieve specific Pokémon data.

## Steps

### 1. Install Postman Extension on VSCode

- Make sure to enable Settings Sync in settings
- Look up the Postman extension and install it

### 2. Create a Postman Account

- Open Postman Extension and create a new account (or sign in if you already have one).

### 3. Explore the PokeAPI

- We will be using the PokeAPI to retrieve Pokémon-related data.
- Visit the official PokeAPI documentation here: [PokeAPI Documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

### 4. Create and Test a Request

- Using Postman, we will create a GET request to retrieve information about **Pikachu** move set.
- Save your returned JSON in pikachuMoves.json.
- Commit and push. 

- Follow these steps:
1. Open Postman and create a **New Request**.
2. Set the request type to **GET**.
3. Paste the URL in the request bar.
4. Click **Send** and observe the JSON response that includes Pikachu’s data like its **abilities**, **types**, **stats**, and more.


## Group Activity: Pokémon API Exploration

In this activity, you will work together as a group to find specific data from the PokeAPI. Using Postman, you’ll explore different endpoints to gather information. 
Paste the JSON into the results.json, commit and push your changes. 

### Tasks for the Group:

1. **Find another Pokémon**
 - Find the details about another pokemon that isn't pikachu. 
 - Add the JSON to the newPokemon.json file

2. **Find Pokémon Types**
 - Find the details about the **Fire** type pokemons.
 - Add the JSON to the fire.json file

3. **Get Location Data for a Pokémon Encounter**
 - Find out where **Bulbasaur** can be encountered in the game:  
 - Add the JSON to the bulbasaur.json file

4. **Commit and Push**
